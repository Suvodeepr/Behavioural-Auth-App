# 🔐 Behaviour-Based Authentication System

This project is a **machine learning–based security system** that detects malicious user sessions using **behavioral data** instead of only passwords.

It assigns a **risk score (0–100)** to each session and classifies it as:

- ✅ Legitimate  
- ⚠️ Suspicious  
- 🚨 Malicious  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional login systems depend only on usernames and passwords.  
This project improves security by analyzing **how users behave during a session**.

It continuously monitors behavior such as:
- Mouse movement speed  
- Typing speed  
- Scrolling activity  

to detect abnormal or malicious sessions.

oject?

Password-based authentication alone is **not enough** to prevent attacks such as:
- Account takeover  
- Session hijacking  
- Automated bots  

This project adds an **extra security layer** by analyzing user behavior during a session.

## 🔍 What This System Does

For every user session, the system:

- Extracts behavioral features  
- Uses a trained ML model to predict anomaly probability  
- Converts probability into a **risk score (0–100)**  
- Assigns a **risk label** based on severity  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Streamlit – Web application  
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning  
- Pandas & NumPy – Data processing  
- Joblib – Model saving & loading  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The **best model is selected automatically** based on **F1-score**, ensuring balanced detection of malicious sessions.

---

## 🎯 Feature Selection

Important features are selected using **Random Forest Feature Importance**, which helps to:

- Remove unnecessary features  
- Improve model accuracy  
- Reduce noise in prediction  

Only the **most influential features** are used in the final model.

---

## 📊 Risk Scoring Logic

| Risk Score | Session Type |
|-----------|--------------|
| 0 – 50 | Legitimate |
| 51 – 55 | Suspicious |
| 56 – 100 | Malicious |

This allows **continuous and fine-grained security decisions** instead of simple yes/no output.

---

## 🧪 Features Used for Prediction

The Streamlit UI accepts the following features:

- Mouse Average Speed  
- Latitude  
- Longitude  
- Typing Speed (characters per second)  
- Cluster ID  
- Scroll Speed  

These features are scaled using the **same scaler used during training**.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

- **Confusion Matrix** – correct vs incorrect predictions  
- **ROC Curve & AUC** – separation ability  
- **Risk Score Distribution** – score spread  

---

## 🚀 Web Application (Streamlit)

The Streamlit app:

- Takes user input  
- Scales input features  
- Predicts risk score  
- Displays session status in real time  

### Output Examples:
- ✅ Legitimate (Low Risk)  
- ⚠️ Suspicious (Medium Risk)  
- 🚨 Malicious (High Risk)
